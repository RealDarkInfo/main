    I will start with a question. Why is the internet the way it is? The answer is the modern hacker or at least the majority of modern hackers. What does the modern hacker care about?
    Most and by most I mean the upper end of 90% of modern hacks have to do with one of two things. The first is money. Whether its a ransomeware group or some spyware selling your information,
    the main driving force of many hackers is money. The second significant force is information, and not in a good way, ever since the beginning of the internet and computers.
    The main reason for existance has been information. The free and open trade of information and ideas and later in hacking information was stolen to be shared with other hackers, but the modern force of information is not for the sharing or the freedom,
    but for government APTs modern espionage not only on other governments but on its citizens. We live in a world of APTs and organized crime. Hacking and hackers have been privatized and made corporate.
    No longer are the days of passion and the hackers in the past who stole to share and broke to create are in the minority. Those who do create in this modern internet landscape are all,
    but what we need in a world where we have access to unlimited amounts of data it feels like we know so little.

    This is for those who care, for those who still carry the old belief of a truly free and open internet a decentralized global village. For those who still steal to share and break to create.
    We are in the minority. If anything is to change. We must not focus on just the internet, but the physical world. Networking in real life with others to help create a community.
    The dehumanization of the internet is what makes it so easily controlled by the government and corporation. They create laws about it because people do not see it as belonging to them.
    The internet is not a product or a property owned by governments and corporations. It is a network by people, but no longer for people. We are spoon fed their doctored information at the cost of our personal lives.
    We give up everything to them so we can use services that were built upon that should be free. We as hackers must not forget what it originally meant to be a hacker. Hackers create and spread information. Hackers built the internet.
    It is not what its has become. Hackers were feared bacause they were not understood, but the modern hacker has become just that, a thief.
    If you care at all for the future focus on the idea of freedom and creation be passionate because the internet can be a beautiful place.
    Steal to share, break to create, that is what it means to be a hacker.
