v1.0
**** 1. Ideology ****
1.1. What Is DCC?
* Anti-authoritarian and anti-exploitation. By their nature, this means anti-state and anti-corporation.
* Information repository for the cause and those who will come after us.

1.2. Values
* Freedom of information/knowledge
* Self sufficiency
* Disruption of oppressive and predatory systems/entities
* Continuity. “A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.”

1.3. Approach
* Bitching does nothing.
* Means to an end. Do not get distracted by the small, stupid shit.
* Contributions, no matter how big or small, should impact the greater cause.
* Change does not happen from the outside. Do not waste your time directly opposing things.
** Leverage momentum and what people already believe in. Drive it in the same direction, to its extremes, and it will implode.
** Seek insiders and access.
* Enable your work to be built upon by others.

**** 2. Structure ****
2.1. FIA
DCC architecting. As a decentralized movement, DCC is governed by no one.

2.2. DCC
* Created at will under the DCC tenets.
* Information. Ideology, tradecraft, connections.
* Self-driven. FIA should not need to be involved.
* Public. People are what they contribute--some much, some little--and they will come and go.
* No illicit activity occurs or is discussed here.
* Push activities down the chain. [Not the focus of DCC.]

2.3. Departments
* Can have duplicates due to decentralization
* Created at will by self-appointed leads.
* Leads are advised to keep their hands clean.
* DCC does not care what happens at or below this level, including who is involved. [Structure beyond this level is not prescriptive.]

2.4. [Optional. Determined by department leads. Can have as many layers as desired.]

2.5. Boots on the ground
People inspired to take action based on the information provided by higher. This activity is not sanctioned by higher.
